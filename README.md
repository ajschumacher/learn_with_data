 * [Reproducible research: Stripe’s approach to data science](https://stripe.com/blog/reproducible-research)

 * "Expect the unexpected"
     * indicates that you did something wrong; check and double-check
     * unexpected findings are a reward of looking at data

 * edgeworth checking procedure?

 * markov property and sufficient statistics

 * streaming mean, exponential forgetting mean (see [image](streaming_mean.png)) (in https://youtu.be/PnHCvfgC_ZA)

 * really short summaries of learning algos?
     * lin reg is fancy means
     * decision trees are 20 questions

Organizational idea:
 * What question do I have?
 * What data do I need?
     * That which-card-do-you-flip thing could go here.
 * What is the deal with this data?
 * How do I make an analysis?
 * What is the deal with this analysis?
 * How do I share this analysis?


DO NOT BE CERTAIN
 * cause of much human misery
 * either way (certain of knowing or not knowing: both dishonest)
 * of course, you will have to act as if you believe something (maybe
   something about checking? hmm)
 * epistemology; stages of epistemology
 * maturity
     * Montessori transition
     * some adults don't reach
 * don't trust people who are 100% certain in their claims
 * communicate uncertainty
     * for stupid execs, lots of clarification
         * they want to believe; will hear selectively
     * report facts, not extrapolations (or: report them separately)
     * for mature, less guidance is okay

 * spell check example? (use the guide even when you're a good speller, etc.)


EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED


YOU CAN'T SEE DATA


KEEP IT SIMPLE
